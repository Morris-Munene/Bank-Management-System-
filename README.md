# Bank Management System

A comprehensive **C++** project designed to manage banking operations efficiently. This system allows users to perform essential banking tasks through a secure and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Account Management**: Create, view, and modify user accounts.
* **Transactions**: Securely deposit and withdraw funds.
* **Balance Inquiry**: Check current account status instantly.
* **Data Persistence**: Uses **File Handling** to save all account data, so information is not lost when the program closes.
* **Input Validation**: Ensures that only valid amounts and account numbers are processed.

## 🛠️ Technical Logic
The project demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts:
* **Classes & Objects**: To represent bank accounts and users.
* **File I/O**: Using `fstream` to read and write data to `.txt` or `.dat` files.
* **Control Structures**: Complex `if/else` and `switch` logic for navigation.
